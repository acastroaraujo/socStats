The homework for this week consists on developing two skills:

1.  Writing technical reports using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html).
2.  Data wrangling using the [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package.

Note. You should be able to see the source code for this document in [my github repository](https://github.com/acastroaraujo/socStats/blob/main/week1.qmd) or by clicking on the `</> Code` button at the top, as shown here:

*Note. The YAML for this file is different because this document is technically part of a [quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/).*

## Communication

Skim [Chapter 29](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto) in *R for Data Science* [@wickham2023].[^week2-1]

[^week2-1]: Some additional resources to skim:

    -   <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html>

    -   <https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html>

You will then need to do the following:

1.  Install Zotero in your computer if you haven't already.

2.  Read [Citations from Zotero](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html#citations-from-zotero) and stop reading when you get to "Group Libraries." *This is 3 paragraphs.*

3.  Go to this repository and download any CSL file you want---e.g., I am using the [this one](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/american-journal-of-sociology.csl). Save the file in your Project folder.

4.  Install the following packages:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    install.packages("modelsummary")
    install.packages("flextable")
    install.packages("tinytex")
    ```

    You should also type this into the console after installing `tinytex`:

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```

**Exercise**

Download [this .qmd file](https://github.com/acastroaraujo/socStats/blob/main/quarto_template.qmd) and put it into your project folder.

-   Change Figure 1 (the cat picture) with an image of your liking. Adjust the caption accordingly.

-   Change Equation 1 for a different equation.

    Hint: If your not familiar with writing these sorts of equations, you can ask ChatGPT to generate the latex code for a different equation---e.g., "the normal distribution."

-   Change the "citations paragraph" at the end to so that it corresponds to yourself---i.e.,

-   Edit the YAML file so that it includes your name (`name`), the appropriate date (`date`), a different font (`mainfont`), and whatever csl file you decided to go with (`csl`).

-   Toggle between the Source and Visual editors and try to understand what is going on.

-   Create a pdf and an html file.

    Hint: This is how my [`.pdf`](https://github.com/acastroaraujo/socStats/blob/main/quarto_template.pdf) and [`.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/acastroaraujo/socStats/blob/main/quarto_template.html) files look like.

-   Upload the `.qmd`, `.pdf`, and `.html` files to your github repository.

## Data Wrangling

::: callout-note
**Multiple Exercises**

Read [Chapter 4](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) of R4DS [@wickham2023] and complete the following exercises:

-   **4.2.5:** all six exercises

-   **4.3.5:** all seven exercises

-   **4.5.7:** all six exercises

Answer these exercises in a quarto document and upload both `.qmd` and `.html` files to your github repository, just as you did for last week's homework.
:::

***Yes, this means that for this week you will upload five different files to your github repository!***
